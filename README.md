Git is a powerful tool that
constantly keep track of every change
you make to your files, aka local.

GitHub acts as that central
online server where the entire
project lives, making it easy for
everyone to see, edit, and share updates
in one single place, aka remote.

a repository is a place where all
the versions of your files and their
complete change history are stored. 
In
the case of a local repository, it's a
specific folder on your own computer.
For a 
remote repository, it lives on a
cloud server like GitHub. 

You can think
of a repository as a digital cabinet for
your code, a secure place where Git
neatly stores every record of your work
and every change you have ever made.

--- how the local part works ---

In your computer, the folder where you are
working on your project is called the
working directory. 
This is where all the
action happens. You write code, create
new files, modify existing ones, and
make changes as needed. 
And when you
feel all right, this version looks good
and want to save this change. That's when
you move on to the next stage in git workflow.

Staging
process is the second phase in Git's
workflow.
Staging area is a middle
ground, a temporary space where files
sit between your working directory and
the final save in the repository.
Once
you have reviewed everything and you are
confident the work is correct, you
commit it.

Committing means permanently
saving those changes to your local
repository, locking them in as a
recorded version of your project's
history.

First, we work inside
our local working directory. Once we are
done, we stage our changes and then
commit those staged files to the local
repository.
